# GLITCHER - Password Update

## Overview

I have successfully updated the login password in the Glitcher application from "Glitcher-mod1212" to "godveaq" as requested.

## Changes Implemented

### Password Update
- Changed login password from "Glitcher-mod1212" to "godveaq"
- Updated both the main login form (with image) and the fallback login form
- Maintained all other login functionality and UI elements

## Technical Implementation

The implementation includes:

- Updated password check in the main login form with image background
- Updated password check in the fallback login form (when PIL is not available)
- Preserved all other login functionality including:
  - Enter key support
  - Error messages for invalid passwords
  - Window closing on successful authentication
  - Focus management

## User Experience

Users will now need to enter "godveaq" as the password to access the Glitcher application. All other aspects of the login process remain unchanged, including the image background, positioning of elements, and user interface behavior.
