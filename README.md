```bash
npm start
```

2. The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

3. Configure your browser to use Glitcher as a proxy:
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `8080`

4. Access Glitcher interface at `http://localhost:8080`

5. To access via `http://glitch`, you need to:
   - Add an entry to your system's hosts file (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts` on Windows)
   - Add the line: `127.0.0.1 glitch`
   - Restart your browser after making this change

### Python GUI Version

1. Run the Python GUI application:

```bash
python run_glitcher.py
```

2. The Glitcher GUI will open with all the same functionality as the web version

3. Use the tabs to access different security testing tools

4. The Python version provides the same professional security testing capabilities as the web version

## How to Use

### Proxy Functionality
- Toggle interception on/off using the Proxy panel
- All HTTP/HTTPS traffic routed through the configured proxy will be captured
- Review and modify requests in the HTTP history table
- Send requests to Repeater or Intruder for further testing

### Intruder
- Select an attack type (Sniper, Battering Ram, Pitchfork, Cluster Bomb)
- Paste an HTTP request in the request editor
- Add payloads to test in the payloads section
- Click "Start Attack" to begin testing

### Repeater
- Paste an HTTP request in the request editor
- Modify the request as needed
- Click "Send" to send the request and view the response

### Target
- Add target URLs to build a site map
- Monitor and analyze the target application structure

### Site Package
- Automatically crawl and analyze websites
- Display discovered URLs in a hierarchical structure
- Analyze URLs for vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)
- Extract comments from source code
- Find hidden URLs in page source
- Click on URLs to see detailed analysis on the right panel

## Architecture

Glitcher operates as a man-in-the-middle proxy:

```
Browser ↔ Glitcher Proxy ↔ Target Web Server
```

All traffic between the browser and target server passes through Glitcher, allowing for inspection, modification, and analysis.
